    <h1>Understand  The <br> Legislative <br> Branch</h1>
    <p>The Legislature plays a fundamental role in shaping our nation's laws and policies. It serves as the cornerstone of democracy, where elected representatives debate, draft, and pass legislation that reflects the will of the people. In this section, we dive deep into the inner workings of the legislative branch, exploring how laws are created, the responsibilities of lawmakers, and the impact of their decisions on our daily lives. With interactive content and engaging activities, we aim to demystify the legislative process, making it accessible and interesting for everyone. Get ready to understand how decisions are made in Parliament, the role of debates and discussions, and the journey of a bill from proposal to law.
